# Plaid CTF 2014: 

**Category:** Forensics
**Points:** 450

> Our archaeologists recovered a dusty and corrupted old hard drive used by The Plague in his trips into the past. It contains a private key, but this has long since been lost to bitrot. Can you recover the full key from the little information we have recovered?

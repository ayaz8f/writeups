**Category:** Misc
**Points:** 250

> The Plague has a friend called Alice who has some secrets on a tor service. We think if we can talk to her, we can learn some useful things about The Plague. Unfortunately she will only rendezvous with "chandler" when he brings a cookie with "beef" baked into it. Can you help us find her secret?
